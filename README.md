# skiTester
## The purpose is to create ski glide testing equipment. 
Test results are based on the time used between the magnet gates. The idea is not unique and already has several commercial implementations. 
However, the price of these is not in any way justifiable for a hobbyist skier, and a hobbyist's mindset includes doing things myself.
