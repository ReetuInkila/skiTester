# skiTester

The purpose is to create ski glide testing equipment.

Test results are based on:
- Time measured between magnet gates  
- Average acceleration during the run

The idea is not unique and already has several commercial implementations.  
However, the price of these is not justifiable for a hobbyist skier, and a hobbyist mindset includes building things independently.

## Application status

- Only the **SwiftUI (iOS)** version of the application is currently under development.
- Other platform versions are not in active development at this time.
